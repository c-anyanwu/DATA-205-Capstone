# DATA-205-Capstone: A Data Science Exploration of Community Design/Infrastructure and Public Health Outcomes
Workspace for DATA 205 Capstone Project
Topics: Public Health and Community Infrastructure

Background
The way we design communities shapes our health. This project investigates the connections between physical features of communities and resident health using R and Tableau.

Objective
1. Analyze the relationships between community design elements (e.g., housing age, access to green space, internet access) and public health indicators (e.g., obesity rates, chronic disease prevalence, mental health outcomes). Identify design patterns associated with positive health outcomes. Explore potential social and economic factors that might influence these relationships.

Methodology
1. I will utilize publicly available CDC data sets on public health outcomes and community infrastructure (Housing age, internet access, english proficiency) and public health outcomes data. I will engage in data cleaning and statisitcal modeling and maybe machine learning with R.
2. Programs: R and Tablaeu (Mayber Power BI)

Expected Goals
1. This project aims to provide data-driven insights into how community design impacts public health. The results can inform urban planning strategies that promote healthy living environments and improve overall population health. It can also provide information on how to better structure public health initiatives to help certain people. 

Guiding Questions
1. How does community infrastructure like age of housing impact access to internet?
2. If yes to question 1, how do these two factors impact vaccination rates and diseases frequency (hard to access healthcare help?)
3. Does limited English proficient impact mental health? (Limited access to foreign community?)


Data Sets Used
1. CDC Internet Access Data (Querried from CDC Public Health Tracking Network)
2. CDC Housing Units Built Before 1980 Data (Querried from CDC Public Health Tracking Network)
3. CDC Public Health Outcomes Data (Querried from CDC Public Health Tracking Network)
4. CDC English Proficiency by Census Tract Data (Querried from CDC Public Health Tracking Network)

Part 1: Background
1. Why is this project important?
2. What do I hope to learn?
3. where is my data coming from?


Part 2: Exploratory Data Analysis 
1. Clean the data for further usage
2. Create simple preliminary visualizations to get a sense of data (Bar plot, scatter plot)
3. State simple observations
4. Alter research questions if necessary 


Part 3: Data Products
1. Data Dashboard w/Tableau
2. Find shapefile with census tracts for all USA and MD
3. Regression Modeling
4. More complex visualization


Part 4: Results 
1. Analysis of linear model results
2. Walkthrough of data dashboard
3. Walkthrough of complex visuals 


Par 5: Conclusion/Analysis
1. What can your county do with the data?
2. What can the broader US do with the data ?


Part 6: Reflection
1. What could you have done better?
2. What do you hope to explore further?
3. Are there any other tools you should have used?
